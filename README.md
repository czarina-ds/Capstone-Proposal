# Capstone Project Proposals

## Proposal #1
Using [Rent The Runway Dataset](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#clothing_fit), I want to predict product rating using NLP on customer reviews, Time Series Forecasting on date rented/reviewed, and Regression or neural network algorithm on the remaining features (numerical and categorical). 

Rent The Runway allows people to rent clothes.

The Data:
- Number of customers: 105,508
- Number of products: 5,850
- Number of transactions: 192,544

([Also found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation?select=renttherunway_final_data.json))

## Proposal #2
Using [Women's Intimate Apparel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/innerwear-data-from-victorias-secret-and-others), I want to predict the price of product across different companies using NLP on product description, and Regression or neural network algorithm on the remaining features (numerical and categorical). 

Number of Products per Company:
- Aerie: 24,488
- Amazon: 26,251
- B.tempt'd: 3,155
- Calvin Klein: 4,276
- Hanky Panky: 33,138
- Macy's: 39,730
- Nordstrom: 11,723
- Topshop: 2,990
- Victoria's Secret: 423,190

Total of 568,941 products

## Proposal #3
Using [Instacart Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview), I want to recommend items to users for their next orders using clustering and market segmentation.

*The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, we provide between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. We also provide the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.*
